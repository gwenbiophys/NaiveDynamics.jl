In my Dev environment, Iwant as little loaded as possible. Thus, the extensions, but I am tetsint in my dev environment, which means I don&#39;t get to use the extension functionality. I believe it would work better for a user situation, in which the Julia environment is not this package&#39;s source code. idk</li><li>[x] struct instantiate with function for neighborsearch items, so changes to the API are more clear to impelment (but also slightly more tedious)</li><li>[x] if we use the Julia built in environment instead of our own, could we finally have extensions working correctly, so that we are devved into naive dynamics and using the local dev version wiht a napkin test file, while also being abel to use only the dependencies and extensions we want?</li><li>[x] investigate if other Julian threading routines produce better results.

I think yes tests that parallelized evaluations work as expected. but idk about like, safe usage of files so a &#39;user&#39; doesn&#39;t break their local data. and should it go even further to the correct syntactical use of svectors vs mvectors? i think these are too far, unless this becomes both a research AND teaching repo.</li></ul><h4 id="bugfixes-from-prior-versions-2"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#bugfixes-from-prior-versions-2">bugfixes from prior versions</a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#bugfixes-from-prior-versions-2" title="Permalink"></a></h4><h3 id="perf-considerations"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#perf-considerations">perf considerations</a><a id="perf-considerations-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#perf-considerations" title="Permalink"></a></h3><ul><li>[] are inbounds valid in the force vector calculations?
