I have been working on my baseline code but really hardening my documentation so that I have a well collected space to start hucking my thoughts. </p><p>For instance, I added CSV and NamedArrays .jl to prepare for testing on whether the </p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">mutable struct GenericObjectCollection &lt;: ObjectCollection 
    name::AbstractArray{String, 1}

    position::AbstractArray{AbstractFloat, 3}
    velocity::AbstractArray{AbstractFloat, 3}

    uniqueID::AbstractArray{UUID,1}

end</code></pre><p>makes any sense, or if I should place all this information into a single array. And then I could test how this version of GenericObjectCollection scales, comparing it against a NamedArray convention. The primary point is to minimize processing time on putting these arrays together, while keeping my function accesses to data meaningful. I do not want the following:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">Collection = [AbstractArray{String, 1}, AbstractArray{AbstractFloat, 3}, AbstractArray{AbstractFloat, 3}]
function do_something(Collection)
    return Collection[1] - Collection[2]
end</code></pre><p>in which function writing depends on making sure I have the right index of my Collection, so I don&#39;t do something stupid, like add a force term to a velocity term. I admit, something like <code>position = Collection[3]</code> is reallly easy, but we are here for overengineered solutions. ;)</p><p>But then my julia package would not precompile! Because I added new packages without updating the project.toml, so I had to relearn how to add new dependencies to a package.</p><p>It has been an hour and I still haven&#39;t figured out how to automatically get docstrings for functions passed into an index/api page, like they have it over at Molly.jl. Oh well, it is likely far better to get the gh-pages version of the documentation working.</p><h2 id="2.-3-May-packaging-packages-locally"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#2.-3-May-packaging-packages-locally">2. 3 May - packaging packages locally</a><a id="2.-3-May-packaging-packages-locally-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#2.-3-May-packaging-packages-locally" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>in order to point a test file to my development package and skipall the githubbing and comppiling, i must</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">pgk() dev ./NaiveDynamics.jl

Thank you very much, Revise.jl/stable. To hell with you, Copilot.</p><h3 id="Let&#39;s-talk-about-DataFrame-ification"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Let&#39;s-talk-about-DataFrame-ification">Let&#39;s talk about DataFrame-ification</a><a id="Let&#39;s-talk-about-DataFrame-ification-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Let&#39;s-talk-about-DataFrame-ification" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>In the commits last weekend I was very focused on modifiying this package&#39;s structure so that a user, regardless of usecase, could design functions around their data in the <code>ObjectCollection</code> type WITHOUT relying on the order of set items in the type. In the current <code>collect_objects()</code> function, I have this nonsense:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">    simCollection = GenericObjectCollection(
        fill(step_n, objectcount),
        fill(&quot;duck&quot;, objectcount),
        [1:objectcount;],
        [SizedVector{3, Float64}(rand(positionRange, 3)) for each in 1:objectcount],
        [SizedVector{3, Float64}(rand(velocityRange, 3)) for each in 1:objectcount],
        [SizedVector{3, Float64}(zeros(Float64, 3)) for each in 1:objectcount],
        )</code></pre><p>when I would prefer a semantics based method that does not depend on the order of inputs. After a lot of testing I just tossed in a big dataframe and a little dataframe. I ran a 1 step simulation of 100 000 atoms, and execution time took at least 3.7 seconds and processed through a humonculous 2GiB of data. I tweaked it a little, and then it wouldnt run anymore at all for OutOfMemory errors. So it became my new task to performance test again and again on all the different methods and packages I could find for multiplying two arrays by broadcasting. We got to a very good place with generating position vectors:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">position = [MVector{3, Float64}(rand(posRange, 3)) for each in 1:5]</code></pre><p>and with performing the multiplication, as base.broadcast has no idea how to solve a vector of mutable vectors:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">function posVel_multiply!(position, velocity)
    for i in eachindex(position)
        position[i] .*= velocity[i]
    end
    return position
end</code></pre><p>We had a path to de-dataframe-ification and a massive performance improvement. But we still had not solved the convenience problem, but ya know what? I&#39;m good with inconvenient. I have spent a long time trying to solve a problem that isn&#39;t a problem. I can winback my semantics with statements at the beginning of a function, like in simulate where we unwind the datatype hierarchy to pull the position array of arrays out of the &quot;system&quot; type. It&#39;s a less beautiful solution maybe, but no less effective.</p><p>And how much better is life? Sans parallelism and multithreading–just from algorithmic and datatype-selection improvements– we need to run the 100k simulation out to ~60 steps for it to take as long as the DataFrame&#39;s version. And we need to run at least 130 steps to generate as much information as the DataFrame&#39;s 1 step. Not that I blame the package&#39;s authors, it was a very silly idea to turn a highly versatile data processing tool into the DNA of the organism that forms this Naive package. </p><p>There are still algorithmic improvements to be made. I wanted to use a vector of mutable vectors, like this:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">using StaticArrays
using Distributions

minposition = -5.0
maxposition = 5.0
posRange = Uniform(minposition, maxposition)
velRange = Uniform(minposition, maxposition)
position = [MVector{3, Float64}(rand(posRange, 3)) for each in 1:5]
velocity = [MVector{3, Float64}(rand(velRange, 3)) for each in 1:5]


function posVel_multiply!(position, velocity)
    for i in eachindex(position)
        position[i] .*= velocity[i]
    end
    return position
end

posVel_multiply!(position, velocity)</code></pre><p>but the posVel_multiply! does not work in the simulate!() function, and I have absolutely no clue why. It looks to be an active issue on github, and substituting the mutablevector with a sized vector solves the issue. But at low atoms counts, performance falls back by about 20%, and it balloons as count increases. At 100k atoms, it appears about 10x slower than a mutable vector, at about 3ms for the broadcasted multiplication alone. In context, the sized vector can only multiply the position and velocity vectors in about 50 ms per step, and this is an engine with zero interactions. </p><p>However the logging of the simulation actually takes longer than everything else under <code>simulate!()</code>, so there are several angles of optimization before we even consider threading or SIMD operations that the compiler doesn&#39;t already perform.</p><p>But for now we have an angle of approach a velocity verlet stepper that will help bring the time per step back up to &gt;1 second</p><h3 id="Towards-a-VerletVelocity-Lennard-Jones-fluid"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Towards-a-VerletVelocity-Lennard-Jones-fluid">Towards a VerletVelocity Lennard-Jones fluid</a><a id="Towards-a-VerletVelocity-Lennard-Jones-fluid-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Towards-a-VerletVelocity-Lennard-Jones-fluid" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>The present implementation of <code>unique_pairlist</code> scales at least with BigO(n^2), drawing out execution time for 1 step at 100k particles to over 20 minutes. So the CellListMap method will be used to calculate neighbors instead until I either learn about how it works or come up with some Naive mapping routine. I wonder if there is some shenanigans to pull around by drawing a weirdly shaped matrix, and in so instantiating it, we will determine all of the unique pairs in the our dataset, then we just have to redraw the matrix into a very long vector. However, maybe the real magic of the CellListMap method is the ability to avoid first defining all unique pairs and then asking which ones are within a given distance. And instead it somehow directly creats a list of unique pairs using the distance as the &#39;first&#39; metric, rather than the last metric. Whatever it is I do want to continue investigating this and create a real Naive method, just to explore the algorithms and the sense of going from</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">    for i in eachindex(position)
        for j in eachindex(position) 
            if j &gt; i
                push!(list, SVector(position[i],position[j]))
            end
        end
    end</code></pre><p>to something not only more useful, but requiring different coding techniques.</p><p>I haven&#39;t an idea how these would even work, so for now let&#39;s just make CellListMap operable.So we are not quite making CellListMaps, but neighbor lists instead. Not as fancy but still excellent.</p><p>If the <code>force_currentstep</code> is the sum of each force acting on/within the system, must I necessarily allocate and deallocate an array for each force and then broadcast-add them to <code>force_currentstep</code>, or could I instead perform each force-calculation using <code>force_currentstep</code> as an argument and returning it?  I believe the second method is more memory efficient but less parallelizable, when the first method is parallelizable until my device runs out of memory. Naively, doing work sequentially would look either like a series of equal signs</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">force_currentstep = LennJones_force!(force_currentstep)
force_currentstep = coulomb_force!(force_currentstep)
etc</code></pre><p>or as a nested set of functions</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">force_currentstep = coulomb_force!(LennJones_force!(force_currentstep))</code></pre><p>For the sake of difference, let&#39;s use the nested set one :) . Here&#39;s an ambition: a simulation-time optimization-suite that detects pending out of memory error/is system aware and decides if we have to focus on memory management or we can go wild in parallel</p><h2 id="3.-12-May-curious-learning-moment"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#3.-12-May-curious-learning-moment">3. 12 May - curious learning moment</a><a id="3.-12-May-curious-learning-moment-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#3.-12-May-curious-learning-moment" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>So today I have overhauled how positions are generated to allow the user to define the size of the box with different sizes in each dimension. This is in preparation for defining a reflective box boundary later on. And we are in a strange situation, when calling the code </p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">pairslist = InPlaceNeighborList(x=position, cutoff=0.1, parallel=false)</code></pre><p>in my simulate! function, CellListMap.jl checks the position values&#39; maximum and minimum according to their datatype. This check fails because for whatever reason, the number type in the position vector of vectors is an AbstractFloat, despite verification demonstrating that there are real values here. What is even stranger is that I have asked the datatype of my position numbers immediately after creation, and they are Float64. I even tried changing the definition in the constructor GenericRandomCollector from AbstractFloat&#39;s to Float64&#39;s. </p><p>Here is the list of things that separate the position vector from it&#39;s point of creation to the point of being bassed on to INPL: </p><ol><li>The vecOfMVecs is created under <code>generate_positions(Collector)</code> and is correctly typed as Float64.</li><li>The vecOfMVecs is retured from <code>generate_positions(Collector)</code> to the positions spot where simCollection is initialized in <code>collect_objects(Collector)</code> and is incorrectly typed as AbstractFloat. It appears that the initialization of a GenericObjectCollection datatype is corrupting the Float64 to AbstractFloat. This seems as unexpected behavior to me, why would it do this? Redefining the GenericObjectCollection fixes the issue. But why would a concrete type ever be reverted back to an abstract type?</li></ol><p>Because Julia is a bit sneaky with type promotion. I misremembered that Julia never promoted types from concrete to abstract. A way of solving this issue, I have learned, is to introduce parametric typing into my code. And this is very exciting! I didn&#39;t quite understand any applications of parametric typing (mostly for lack of effort) and here is one just for me! Parametric typing to prevent promotion, moreover, to perform type inferencing based only on the user input.  </p><h3 id="Reworking-broadcasting-and-operators-in-velocity-verlet-method"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Reworking-broadcasting-and-operators-in-velocity-verlet-method">Reworking broadcasting and operators in velocity verlet method</a><a id="Reworking-broadcasting-and-operators-in-velocity-verlet-method-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Reworking-broadcasting-and-operators-in-velocity-verlet-method" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Because we have to work with neighbor listing and mapping to calculate our forces, it&#39;s a bit harder to <code>simulate!()</code> by having a nested loop going over every atom. So instead we have to rewrite the calculation of each line somehow. I tried various methods</p><ol><li>Broadcast-broadcast by using a unique syntax</li></ol><p><code>⊕(a, b) = a .+ b</code> and then calling <code>.⊕</code> to reach the data points within our VecOfVecs</p><ol><li>Mapping a broadcasted-operator to our VecOfVecs</li></ol><p><code>map!(.*, $a,$b)</code> and <code>map!(./, $a,$b, $a)</code></p><ol><li>Dumloop over each item of the outer-vector, and then broadcast an operation to each item</li></ol><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">function dumloop_multiply!(d, e)

However, maybe I can avoid this nonsense by working on how the force is calculated. And I have done that. </p><h3 id="JL-force"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#JL-force">JL force</a><a id="JL-force-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#JL-force" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>And I quickly ran into a new problem: The neighborlist method in CellListMap.jl returns a vector of tuples <code>(indexA, indexB, distance_as_the_fish_swims)</code>, when my algorithms demand vectorized data. I need a neighborlist algorithm to return me a tuple of <code>indexA, indexB, MVector(distanceX, distanceY, distanceZ), distanceLine</code> in order to correctly calculate the component forces and the overall energy of these interactions. Or maybe I can code that myself hahah!</p><p>This would involve using the CellListMap interface, but I have a streaming method in which each atom is given a block of calculations to run through, so parallelism would primarily come from the top forloop by calculating multiple atoms at once in more or less the same procedure. So I <strong>really</strong> need to make a naive neighbor list with all of the data I need, or otherwise figure out how to pull that information out of CellListMap, but that place is designed to scare people.</p><p>A further quandary arises from the highly differing behaviors of neighborlist() and the <code>InPlaceNeighborList()</code>, <code>neighborlist!()</code>, and <code>update!()</code> which is the latter does not return the neighbor list vector of tuples, but a complicated data structure series. It is possible that this series contains my data of xyz distances, but sheesh. It may be happier if I provided box-boundaries, as the compute engine takes a boundary that is either user determined or limited by the values expressable in the data-type of the coordinate (Float64 makes the InPlaceNeighborList object fill up the entire REPL with almost only zeros, we learned from our type promotion earlier). Let&#39;s see how slow the sim engine is now, and maybe we might consider making a switch to NearestNeighbors.jl</p><h3 id="the-simulation-BREAKS"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#the-simulation-BREAKS">the simulation BREAKS</a><a id="the-simulation-BREAKS-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#the-simulation-BREAKS" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Testing the package as it presently stands, it works fine for 100 atoms, but the upperbound number is falling as I examine it by hitting the mid point between the working number and the failing number. Currently, the simulation crashes out at or below 600 atoms. This is a method error, <code>MethodError: objects of type StaticArraysCore.MVector{3, Float64} are not callable</code> that points to these two lines in Simulator.jl:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">d = position[i] .- position[j]

Very gentle, here&#39;s the fixed function: </p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">force[i] .+= (24*eps ./ d )((2*σ ./ d).^12 - (σ ./ d).^6)</code></pre><p>Onto the next breakage <code>InexactError: trunc(Int64, 3.884345474457886e38)</code>.  A more severe one, I fear. It points to the <code>neighborlist()</code> function call. We are going to update CellListMap and pray. A new release came about 3 days ago sooo we should be good, right? <em>Oh dear.</em> Going from 1000 to 10 000 particles seems to drastically increase the size of the error here, from about 10^20 to 10^30 through and beyond 10^50. So we have to figure out what value is being created that is so extremely stratospheric, and it is created seemingly each time enough particles are created to exist in less than the cut off. Let&#39;s increase cut off and reduce atoms. Now we are getting different errors regardless of using a function or sitting in global scope, outofmemory, invalid array size, invalid array dimensions, and sometimes the truncation error. Each of these errors occur in the neighborlist run. For the truncation error, the problematic calculation is Line 213 of Box.jl. </p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs">_nc = floor.(Int, (xmax .- xmin) / (cutoff / lcell)) </code></pre><p>NearestNeighbors.jl hass it&#39;s own problem that the most recent issue shows a method error that prevents the use of Vector(MVector()) so that may not be a solution.</p><p>Ah but wait, I did not correctly construct my force updates. Now it is working! I am uncertain how I was obliterating the neighborlist by not calculating forces correctly, but it is a strange world. Now it is not working anymore, after I increased the stepcount. Failing in the neighbor list for multiple different reasons. There are 3 erros, out of memory, invalid arraysize, invalid array dimenions, and they all are genereated in line 482 of CellLists.jl</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">    cl = CellList{N,T}(
        n_real_particles=length(x),
        number_of_cells=prod(box.nc),
    )</code></pre><p>It is almost as though the REPL gets &#39;gunked&#39; up from multiple rounds of <code>simulate!()</code> Or that perhaps at times two particles land on top of each other or there is some other issue. The gunking theory fell out because no change resulted in a successful run.</p><p>We have 2 issue classes, truncation from Box.jl 213 and CellLists.jl 482.</p><p>Wait a minute, perhaps the particles are falling in too close and the forces are spiraling out of control. Changing epsilon by 1000x either way seemed to have little effect. While reducing sigma by 1000x seemed to improve success and increasing seemed to mkae failure fairly common. However, success is not guaranteed within 100 or 1000 runs. Hopefully with a pruning routine, things will turn out just fine. An additional helper is increasing the cutoff.

Thanks to the university of michigan for their informative article.</p><p>Before I worry about pulling in NearestNeighbors.jl or seeing how long it would take to make a naive BVH neighbor finder, I am allocation hunting in my simulation to increase speed. I was primarily worried that <code>force_currentstep = force_nextstep</code> would de/allocate, as I often run into the problem that <code>a = 5, b = a, b += 1, but a !== 6</code>, but the compiler knows what it&#39;s doing. We instead run into a much more interesting problem:</p><p>To perform Velocity-Verlet integration, we use broadcasting to calculate the xyz-components of position for each particle:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">position[i] = position[i] .+ (velocity[i] .* stepwidth) .+ (force_currentstep[i] ./ mass[i] .* stepwidth^2/2)</code></pre><p>Benchmarking showed an allocation was made, so I set to improve it:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">positionJ[i] .+= ((velocity[i] .* stepwidth) .+ (force_currentstep[i] ./ mass[i] .* stepwidth^2/2))</code></pre><p>The two methods should obviously (to me) produce the same output, and are seemingly just format differences. However when calculating positionJ, we increase speed, 16 -&gt; 10 ns, and eliminate allocation, 32 bytes -&gt; 0. That alone, positionJ seems to be the idea choice. But why the difference?</p><p>More importantly, what about correctness? positionJ and position produce different results about 5% of the time. It turns out positionJ&#39;s method is internally consistent, while position&#39;s is not internally consistent. And that is wild.</p><p>We find internal consistency by either removing the velocity-stepwidth term, or by using positionJ&#39;s method. Removing the addition of <code>(force_currentstep[i] ./ mass[i] .* stepwidth^2/2)</code> to position does not affect internal consistency. Furthermore, switching the order of operations</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">position[i] = position[i]  .+ (force_currentstep[i] ./ mass[i] .* stepwidth^2/2) .+ (velocity[i] .* stepwidth)
positionK[i] = positionK[i] .+ (velocity[i] .* stepwidth) .+ (force_currentstep[i] ./ mass[i] .* stepwidth^2/2)</code></pre><p>also has no affect, position and positionK&#39;s methods are still inconsistent with each other.</p><p>So, I just made my code faster* and more precise by changing how it was spelled. What a weird world. *A savings of 6 ns per calculation doesn&#39;t register at the ms level in my short-small test, but memory usage and allocations are reduced by 6.7 and 7.7 percent, respectively. </p><p>The next line of question, why is simulate!() (with neighborlisting and force-calculating deactivated) so slow and allocating so often? Internally, the function should allocate only a few times, with each action taking fewer than 50 ns, and most actions taking fewer than 20 ns. Changing the index scheme from <code>for step_n in 1:steps</code> to <code>for step_n in eachindex(step_array) where step_array = [1:steps;]</code> reduced allocations by 1. Further changing this scheme to a zeros-array that is steps long reduced allocations by 51. Testing shows that allocations scale linearly with the number of steps, which is incorrect.</p><p>So my old method will allocate several intermediate array slices on the heap. If I run away from the inner for loop for each particle, I drop allocations by half with no further optimization. Each operation allocates a new intermediate array. So we have to use the staticarray to get over this problem</p><pre><code class="nohighlight hljs"> 28.200 μs (3057 allocations: 122.11 KiB) with mutable Vector

Well not yet, because we still have allocation scaling with step length, so changing datatypes is no sure-fire solution.</p><p>After testing, a problem is shown with how Julia processes complex expressions, such as the position-update:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">position[i] += velocity[i] * stepwidth .+ force_currentstep[i] ./ mass[i] .* stepwidth^2/2</code></pre><p>Several arrays are here allocated and deallocated within the string, and when we have for-each-step and for-each-particle, we end up with absurd allocation figures and runtimes. When we decompose this expression and we allow the compiler to run  on the entire block of particles positions, we obtain extreme speed and constant allocation for simulation size. The only problem is <em>readability</em>. The position calculation becomes:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">positionIntermediate1 = velocity

    for i in eachindex(vec)
        vec[i] .*= vec2
    end
end</code></pre><p>We avoid any allocations within for-each-step by writing over intermediate values  at each step. These are generated ahead of the simulation loop. I&#39;ve made multiple attempts with nested broadcasting or broadcasted mapping, and these methods result in allocations for each particle, but reducing each value transformation to either a direct substitution or a loop&#39;ed broadcast worked best. Here is where things get really confusing. As part of updating position and velocity due to only the velocity and apparent forces, we have to evaulate 9 for-each-particle loops at every simulation step. So what if we reduced the loops into a single loop which defines a block of numbers to crunch for every particle. That was my original idea in this simulation. Julia hates this idea:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">for step_n in eachindex(steps_array)

        for i in eachindex(objectindex)

            positionIntermediate1[i] = velocity[i] 
            positionIntermediate1[i] .*= stepwidth
            positionIntermediate2[i] = force_currentstep[i] 
            positionIntermediate2[i] ./= mass[i] 
            positionIntermediate2[i] .*= stepwidthSqrdHalf
            position[i] .+= positionIntermediate1[i] 
            position[i] .+= positionIntermediate2[i]

            velocityIntermediate1[i] .= force_currentstep[i] .* force_nextstep[i]
            velocityIntermediate1[i] ./= mass[i]
            velocityIntermediate1[i] .*= stepwidthHalf
            velocity[i] .+= velocityIntermediate1[i]

        end

We can just avoid loop hell, keep the syntax clean-ish, and improve performance and allocations. But static vectors aren&#39;t as workable. You cannot iterate, broadcast, map over them, so then I have no idea how to institute boundary conditions if I cannot analyze or affect any particular value. However, I could instead use StaticArrays methods to affect test mutable-vectors, and depending on the values within these test vectors, I can apply action vectors over the elements of our static vectors. This could make for a beautiful evaluation, and allow me to get rid of the naive boundary function:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">function boundary_reflect!(ithCoord, ithVelo, collector::Collector)

Some more time spent looking at the work may help, such as trying to restream the functions into a single task, rather than the current split method we are rocking with.</p><p>I spent some time trying to understand how we can reduce the 6 loops that calculate position by using broadcasting to achieve <em>syntactic loop fusion</em>, but the compiler has no idea how to achieve this in my context and it just continuously allocates temporary arrays instead of looping around each piece. And it is shown that this effort at loop reduction simply recreates the problem in <code>simulate_oneloop!()</code>, which I presently suspect is some violation of cache locality. Here is the undeveloped code:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">        for i in eachindex(positionIntermediate1)

So until a better method is found or formulated for this data structure, we may very well have to call a <code>dumloop!()</code> to calculate each and every modification of our <code>Vec3D</code>, which is going to get very annoying, unless I can embed the function into an operator sign.</p><h2 id="5.-11-June-Starting-up-again"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#5.-11-June-Starting-up-again">5. 11 June - Starting up again</a><a id="5.-11-June-Starting-up-again-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#5.-11-June-Starting-up-again" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>My progress has halted for a few weeks as I have followed the ADHD fixation of hyperoptimizing just the Verlet Velocity scheme until failure. It&#39;s mostly been really enjoyable, and informative, but it causes problems! Static vectors are far more performant and rewrite prone than mutable vectors, which are allocation prone. But their lack of indexability makes my Naive algorithms more complicated. Naive boundary condition? Forces? Velocity rescaling for energy-maintenance? Dihedral interactions? Virtually anything else? All can use a nested for-loop for each particle for each directional component. So while I have a single-threaded, CPU based simulation engine that outperforms Molly.jl for calculating position and velocity from the velocity and forces that act on them, I don&#39;t have much else. I have a force function that must be rewritten, I have a neighbor finder that is innappropriate for this generalized simulation use case, and I have a bunch of slop that needs washing from my source. All of this to say, I have sinned in writing software, and this has been my admission. So now I want to take the opportunity to work on the organization of these docs to reflect what I have worked on and what direction is next. </p><p>But continuing the wonders of optimization anyway: Taking on the method of Molly.jl for position and velocity verlet calculations and adding a generator expression makes it faster than my looped hell expression, bu much more data intensive. Additionally, using mutable vectors with the Molly generator expression is actually faster and more memory volume efficient than the static vector. Now right properly &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; makes sense. However for memory AND allocation efficiency, only the looped-hell expression is winning. (Turns out I just needed some organization and reorientation, with that hyperfixation wobbling.) I still have no idea how to escape this new scenario of either speed or memory efficiency, so we will split simulate along the different methods and continue development from there, allowing for strongly Naive implementations with MVectors, andd maybe eventually we will figure things out to make the SVectors preferred. But I mostly want to stick with MVectors until there is a presented need for SVectors&#39; speed, which currently? Not even close. But maybe once we have some forces, then we will be less confident!</p><h2 id="29-June"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#29-June">29 June</a><a id="29-June-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#29-June" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>I extended the dumloop methods to cover the cases for static and mutable vectors and could get a very simple test bank running. The generator expressions for Mutable vecs are worse than loop hell, 7x slower and 38x more data. For SVecs, generator expressions are 30% slower, while keeping about the same data-efficiency as MVecs. Curiously, SVecs take more data the MVecs, but in both algorithms accumulate the same number of allocations. For simple speed purposes, the SVec generator expression is more than acceptable, being 2x faster than MVec loop hell, even with 24 thousand <em>more</em> allocations. The ultimate speed appears to be loop exclusion SVec, but these, as previously covered, still bring a tantrum for usability. I hope it improves, but I have no idea how. But I think the compromise could be any indexing functions for the SVec data type just copy! to an MVec and then back to SVec after functioning. If that works! And it does, but would require even more fluff outside of the time-step loop. So mutable vectors for now, since we are losing less than 3x performance, and the copy! operations would probably capture some of that improvement from cache-discontinuities. Maybe in the future I will discover how to make this work without</p><p>The boundary reflect. After gutting the entire interior of the function, it still allocates once per step. After type annotating every neatly named variable, still. After type annotating the type of collector to be used in the function call, still! Now it is time to test with other functions, to figure out where this alloc comes from. Getting rid of the function overlay and just tossing the code of boundary<em>reflect! into the body seems to kill performance by a profound lot. <em>Some minutes later.</em>A bug? I created a function no</em>allocs!(position, velocity, collector) with type annotations that did nothing. I placed this below a commented boundary<em>reflect!() in simulate!(), and I get an expected number of allocations. But then, I place the analysis code into no</em>alloc!(), run the code, and now it is allocation hell. Then I remove the analysis code completely, and we are still in allocation hell. Restarting Julia does end allocation hell when no_alloc!() is empty prior to NaiveDynamics precompilation. This certainly makes testing the problem more difficult, but I noticed a doulbe defintion of the same function same method somewhere else, so perhaps fixing that will mean Revise.jl works a little bit better. Curiously, the allocations remain after removing the code block until REPL restart, but execution times drop, suggesting that hey, some new code is no longer being executed (consistent 480 to 415 ms). It seems to me a bug to have evil allocations that appear to be unrelated to the execution of my code. </p><p>Well, regardless of my feelings, the allocation vanishes when the if statement is prevent from evaluating. Provided that any of the if-statements evaluate out to true, then there will be 1 allocation of 96 bytes that is then rewritten across the expression. This seemingly is deallocated at the end of the forloop, and we begin again in the next step of the simulation. However, I am having trouble reproducing this in a fresh file with no dependencies. But regardless of what is being evaluated in context, we still get this allocation. Curiously, if I cleave everything out of boundary_reflect!(), precompile NaiveDynamics, and run@time where the function is called, then the first run of @time generates only 96 bytes of allocated data, but with all the gooey logic, the allocations are much higher. More curiously, replacing @btime causes the allocation to &quot;disappear&quot;. Which is to say, the machinery of @btime sitting at the function call is incapable of catching this allocation, when it catches it at the simulate!() function call, while @time has no problem catching the issue wherever it is called.</p><p>My next idea stands around syntax, where having to consider either <code>position[each][1]</code> or <code>velocity[each][1]</code>, that is to say, the float value within the vectors of vectors, results in a 96 bit allocation that is deallocated at the end of the function call. This I now declare follows in the tea-leaf reading of my @profview<em>allocs that shows an Unknown</em>type garbage collection allocation occuring in the function call / function space of boundary<em>reflect!(). Holy banana. My type declarations crusade earlier was the correct direction, but I failed to specify the type of the inner-value. IT IS SOLVED. Now the problem for the code context, how to grab this T. In the user input, we select as a field of the Collector struct for our precision, but just setting T = collector.T inside  simualte!() does not clarify the type for boundary</em>reflect!(). And now with our types fully allocated, we are down to 19 total allocations, rather than 419. What a good success I think, but this leads us to the next question. I want to have this type stability avoided entirely, but having the position velocity etc. defintions thrown in simulate!() just be renamed entities from our datapaths. How do we get type stability by creating shorthand names or <em>pointers</em> to the specific data we are asking for? I am not certain, Molly gets around it by just having less nested structures or by pulling values into the simulate!() function via another function. So we have cured our type instability, but also broke simulate!() to anything besides a vector of mutable vectors of float64s.</p><p>Exploring my implementation of the boundary<em>reflect!(), I realize that a particle that leaves the box and has its component velocity sign flipped may become trapped outside the box if it cannot re-enter the box before the next boundary</em>reflect!() function call. Instead, the wall should be a secondary force like Lennard-Jones that opposes pasrticle traversal through the wall. The question then is, how do I write a force that will, in effect, flip the sign, but prevent the creation of unrealistic forces? THe simplest solution would seem to be pulling the position back to a small value ahead of the minimum value, which I originally had.</p><p>Managing these package extensions so that I can avoid precopmiling Makie until and unless i want to use a Makie feature is very frustrating. <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/t/should-we-define-new-functions-structs-in-an-extension/103361">Here</a> a discussion focuses package extensions on only extending functions defined in the base of the package. So I suppose I could provide a dummy record_video() in Simulator.jl, but this wouldn&#39;t be extension. This would be substitution functionality. And in <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl/issues/3641">this pull request</a>, the issue seems to be ongoing where people want to modify the methods of &#39;optional&#39; packages. So manual insertion it is, then.</p><p>On debugging NaiveMakie  we have iteration working correctly, as we can print positionsToPlot for each step of      positions::Vector{Vector{MVector{3, Float32}}} / each step of recorded simulation  but these new values are not being plotted  we changed simulate!() so that instead of modifying copies of the fields of ObjectCollection      we are moddying the struct directly  the positions are the same between frames  new position values are not emerging, in either the loop fusion or dumloop hell method  I am hoping that changing the collection structure to mutable will magically fix the issue, but i also worry there are some hyjinx related to variable scope, the same stuff taht prevented the chunk indexing from working.</p><p>Delaying the progress of work substantially is the lacking of a dedicated testing package where tests are just in function in line print statemetns that clutter up the place. And as I continue develoing and rewriting, new breakages occur, such as when I cleaned up the stack of equal signs in simulate<em>bravado!(). Also I have this nasty collection of methods, simulate, simulate bravado, fused bravdo, mvec, svec, and oneloop. I achieved cleaning up the logger mess, but nonetheless it is difficult for working efficiently and easily to go around this boneyard of cold code, even with the use of a scratchpad space for testing specific features, a dev directions page, and a diary to help track my thinking in real time. It is very dangerous to get distracted and forget that I am modifying code in simulate</em>bravado!() instead of simulate!()</p><p>Anyhow, we have made it to the point where the sys.velocity mutates its values correctly, and even in the simChunk, but when the chunk is passed to the simLog, something goes wrong. In a 20 step simulation, we test the following code inside record_video:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">    println(first(simLog).currentstep)
    println(first(simLog).position)
    println(first(simLog).position==last(simLog).position)
    println(last(simLog).position)
    println(last(simLog).currentstep)
    println(simLog[1].position == simLog[2].position)</code></pre><p>And it shows that each index of simLog, which are objectCollections, are the same, and they are the same regardless of simualtion length. What this shows to me is that we are not correctly modifying the values of our simChunk and are instead just pointing to the value in the objectcollection instead. But similar testing in the chunk itself shows that its values at each index are different, indicating that within a simChunk we have time progression. But then when this chunk is passed into the simLog, each index of simLog is pointing to the same simChunk, so we can atmost get information only at the last moment of the simulation, it would appear. And this makes sense, as sometimes I see some particles are missing from the mp4. What is strange is that simChunk is just a fixed width vector of objectCollections, whereas simLog is just a multiple of simChunk, for however many multiples of chunk<em>length fit into the simulation duration.  So my confusion is, why are the 10 chunks of simChunk different from each other, when the same chunks in SimLog are different? Well I just retested it, and they are identical! The code, set right before write</em>chunk!(simLog, simChunk)</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">println(simChunk[1].position==simChunk[9].position)</code></pre><p>evaluates to true, even though I have proven more recently than the variation in my chunk indices the varation in objectcollection.position for each step. This is what I need a dedicated testing module for, to be able to track the results from a given change.  Anyway, the coding problem does make a lot of sense: <code>simChunk[chunk_index] = objectCollection</code> is just stating that simChunk at the chunk_index is a pointer to the object collection. Although according to the docs, performing a[index] = b  will mutate a. So where forces are updated and positionIntermediate1 is upated at each step, it may do well enough to have a for loop or nested for loop to get values updating. So when I print sys.position at the end of each sim step, the values are changing. But each chunk block is not changing. Maybe this is the trouble I read about somehwere of having arrays of structs instead of structs of arrays, Array[Struct] doesnt work the same as Array[Number]. I would most prefer to use <code>fill!(simChunk, objectcollection)</code>, however there is no method matching for this. I have to extend the fill! function to my type, I wonder how much effort that would require. . . Very likely a lot. As fill!() is intended to  be used on a whole array, or part of an array, with a numeric value. The function already collapses in the case of <code>fill!(Vector{MVector{3,Float}}[1], MVector{3,Float})</code>. I require the object I am using to fill an array to be a number, not an entire struct. This is an unfortunate position wherein the only method that appears to work well is the one I have spent a lot of time trying to get rid of, where to store the entire object collection I was pushing each individual field to a parent structure that had nearly the same shape, except each field as a vector of the fields of objectCollection. That method was miserably slow! But I may be able to use chunking with ``` fill!(), as a structure of arrays of arrays will bring me closer to the data points than an array of structures of arrays, and chunking (and more features) should help a lot to speed up time. But for now, the new method is to push the current objectcollection into the simLog at each step. Hopefully I can plan out more how to implement it correctly and be certain to write my notes as i develop.</p><p>Back to the video recording, now I have my positions getting printed out directly and I am learning 2 things. The velocities are trending towards zero arbtirarily. No idea why. And the mp4 is only  recording the last frame, as confirmed by visual inspection of the dots and the printed corrdinates. Though, over repeated tries I am not confident in visual inspection, or my changes to the code have caused a switch to the first frame rather than the last frame.</p><p>I do not know why GLMakie isnt yet rendering the right video. It is quite the delightful tool, and I am likely less than 40 characters from making it right, but it&#39;s function seems consistent with Molly.jl&#39;s implementation, and it doesnt seem inconsistent with teh documentation, I just have to provide a number of frames and that at each frame, we update our observable with new values. Maybe i could try a for loop without observable? I think it fell apart at the onset then. Can&#39;t remember, haha!!</p><p>The record function from Makie is correctly iterating, as an index whose value is printed and incremented inside the function does display correctly. But all the positions are the same, as confirmed inside record, right after simulate. They vary at the end of each sim step, and the values in the log are the same values  the last value of position in the simulation. Something is going wrong with the pushing of the object collection into the simlog, but I do not know how to diagnose it. So I am going to instead push the position to a position log at each step, adjust the return, and adjust NaiveMakie. I have made the adjustments, so now simulate!() returns poslog, a vector of positions where each element is the position at step_n, and these values are all the same! Looking closer, eash time we push!() sys.position into poslog, previously pushed values are updated to the value of the latest addition. That is crazy! I theorize that this is the result of push! being array values oriented, not array of arrays arrays oriented. Append does not work, what about vcat? No, we have to instead push copy.(sys.position). That&#39;s truly mad!!! AHHH it works!!!!!!</p><h2 id="July-4,-Methods-towards-improving-the-development-process"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#July-4,-Methods-towards-improving-the-development-process">July 4, Methods towards improving the development process</a><a id="July-4,-Methods-towards-improving-the-development-process-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#July-4,-Methods-towards-improving-the-development-process" title="Permalink"></a></h2><ol><li>Develop a testing module to hit the code correctness so that I can change how something works, and know almost automatically whether my changes mean that my project no longer works.

I began to suspect that my loop hell testing was only fast because it helped to get around type insecurity. So I tested:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs"># loop hell
positionIntermediate1 = copy.(sys.velocity)
dumloop_multiply!(positionIntermediate1, spec.stepwidth)
positionIntermediate2 = copy.(sys.force) 
dumloop_multiply!(positionIntermediate2, inverse_mass)
dumloop_multiply!(positionIntermediate1, stepwidthSqrdHalf)
dumloop_add!(sys.position, positionIntermediate1)
dumloop_add!(sys.position, positionIntermediate2)

# simple expressions
accels_t = sys.force ./ sys.mass 
sys.position += sys.velocity .* spec.stepwidth .+ ((accels_t .* spec.stepwidth ^ 2) ./ 2)

# generator expressions
(accels_t[i] = sys.force[i] ./ sys.mass[i] for i in eachindex(sys.force))
(sys.position[i] += sys.velocity[i] .* spec.stepwidth[i] .+ ((accels_t[i] .* spec.stepwidth ^ 2) ./ 2) for i in eachindex(sys.position))
</code></pre><p>And the results were strong: at 40 particles and 4000 steps without a neighbor list calculation (so they should all be doing the same number of calculations)   178.058 ms (8319170 allocations: 317.56 MiB) = dumloop   541.077 ms (20239170 allocations: 772.27 MiB) = simple expressions   59.114 ms (5039171 allocations: 191.83 MiB) = generator expressions I am pleased with this result, but wow the generator expressions are quicker, and at this juncture, I do not know why. I understand it being faster, but also more memory efficient? I am suspicious. ~~It&#39;s possible it is to do with temporary allocating in the copy.() calls that occur with dumloop intermediates that the generators don&#39;t have to explicitly state(that I think can be optimized away with a for loop and a fill!()), but consider: The generator expression adds a single in-line for loop, the loop hell is far far more complicated and annoying. Let the compiler do it for me.~~ The generator expressions calculate accels_t and dt but because they are introduced in the for loop they are local to its scope and nothing happens. Fixing that, I still am not seeing the position values change, and I don&#39;t understand why. The generator expressions are not working anymore, when they were working earlier without modification. Strange-world we live in. Maybe I had my function calls confused or something of the sort, I swear I saw a video from the generator expression simulate!() that worked correctly. Well, tossing out the the generator expressions that did less than they should have, now loop hell is once again in the lead for superior allocation performance, a 20x perf advantage and a &lt;3x overall memory advantage. And I confirm both methods give a valid mp4.</p><p>Moving forward, we can try reimplementing my older scheme to reduce temporary allocations, the one that maximized loop fusion but ended up with performance as bad as the one loop method. And we can also update one loop as well. And while reimplementing maximal loop fusion, I found that miscellaneous allocations were being caused by the <code>GenericSpec</code>s, a type conflict in which the specs were offered only the abstract integer form, and preventing the automagic syntactic loop fusion I ahve been chasing this entire time. I run zero allocations with the following expression, now that <em>every</em> variable has a concrete type at or before compile time:</p><pre><code class="language-julia hljs">        for i in eachindex(sys.position)
            sys.position[i] .+= sys.velocity[i] .* spec.stepwidth .+ ((accels_t[i] .* spec.stepwidth ^ 2) ./ 2)
        end</code></pre><p>The compiler has shown that it can get around the need for explicity intermediates, reducing data generation and at least matching the speed of the dumloop method. And it should be simple to exceed the speed with this fully compressed expression.</p><p>We are working towards preventing particles from escaping the box. We readded position locking, which only works if the position coordinate doesnt NaN, as NaN is not greater or less tahan any number. we can increase the duration of the simulation and decrease the velocity range, to hopefully increase the probability that two particles do not appear extremely close together and then fly off at incredible or overwhelming speeds. Velocity rescaling could also help catch some particles, as we aim towards conserving energy in the system. I think tuning down the sigma and epsilon terms could also help, whereas before tuning them but not initial velocity was not enough?</p><p>Also, at 4 million steps and all the nonsense in my background, we are hitting a major memory wall to the point this program may crash.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../">« Home</a><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="../devdirections/">Development Directions »</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="catppuccin-latte">catppuccin-latte</option><option value="catppuccin-frappe">catppuccin-frappe</option><option value="catppuccin-macchiato">catppuccin-macchiato</option><option value="catppuccin-mocha">catppuccin-mocha</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.5.0 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Monday 8 July 2024 13:27">Monday 8 July 2024</span>.
